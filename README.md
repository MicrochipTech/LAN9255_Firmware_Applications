<div align="justify">Microchip LAN9255 Application Examples provide EtherCAT® and Ethernet centric projects to enable rapid development.  Users can target the EVB-LAN9255 platform with this and quickly see device side IO as a network component.  Code here has been generated by the design and applications team behind LAN9255.  It pulls in expertise in EtherCAT and integrates using the MPLABX Harmony framework.
These projects have been put through standard SQA and were used for EtherCAT conformance testing.  The Ethernet project can be built with single PHY or dual port switch support – for end points or daisy chained nodes.
